I am a PhD student, serving my academic overlords on the weekdays. Outside of work:

![🐎](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f40e) I am into running and working out. That's _only_ because I'm trying to make up for a crapy personality.

![📗](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f4d7) Love reading, especially books on History.

![✏](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/270f)️ I am volunteer teacher for 5yr old kids at the local Sunday school. This is primarily because I love the feeling of walking into a room and knowing I'm the smartest one there.

![🍩](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f369) I love going to events for free food. You know... to support their cause or whatever.

![☕](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/2615) My chai is better than most drugs...well most, not all.
